# Experiments

This repo holds a bunch of experimental code. When I get a free moment and do something I think others would like it goes in here.

- **osx_windows** - Duplicating OS X's chrome in CSS
- **rubiks_cube** - Playing with CSS 3D transforms
- **color_wheel** - A colorwheel. D'uh.
- **cross_window_state** - Keeping browser windows in sync
- **trig** - Hyperbolic trig functions

## Webkit

Most of these are done off-the-cuff. Best viewed in webkit.
